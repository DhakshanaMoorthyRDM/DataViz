# DataViz Dashboard

## Project Overview

DataViz is a Python-based dashboard designed for exploring and visualizing datasets. This project leverages Streamlit and various Python libraries to provide interactive data analysis and visualization capabilities. From basic data profiling to advanced modeling and visualization techniques, DataViz offers a comprehensive toolset for gaining insights from your data.

## Features

- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize dataset trends using interactive charts and graphs.
- **Data Profiling**: Generate detailed reports and insights using pandas profiling and ydata_profiling.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Display geographical data using Folium for map visualizations and HeatMaps.
- **Plotting**: Utilize Plotly and Matplotlib for plotting data and generating custom visualizations.
- **Machine Learning**: Perform data transformation, train models (e.g., RandomForestClassifier), and evaluate accuracy.
- **Data Upload and Exploration**: Upload datasets, select columns for analysis, and navigate through different analysis pages.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataViz.git
   cd DataViz
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Dashboard**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Navigate the Dashboard**:
   
   - **Visualize Dataset**: Explore dataset trends and insights through interactive charts.
   - **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis and transformation tasks.
   - **Profiling**: Generate detailed reports on dataset characteristics using pandas profiling and ydata_profiling.
   - **Plotting of Data**: Create custom plots and visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib.
   - **Modelling**: Train machine learning models (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) and evaluate their performance.
   - **Map Visualization**: Visualize geographical data using Folium and HeatMaps.
   - **Interactive Visualization**: Engage with interactive visuals to gain insights based on data perception.

## Usage

Upload your dataset files directly through the dashboard and start exploring the data insights using various analytical tools and visualizations provided.
